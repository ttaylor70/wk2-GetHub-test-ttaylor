<!--
 This is assignment #2 to use CSS to style web pages we made in Assignment 1. 
 (Task is to create a 3 page website using only HTML with links to navigate between pages with 2 different size headers, a list, 3 images, a table, and a form.) FYI I maintain a WordPress site for the CDA Triathlon so I have access to all their images, many of which I took myself.

<!--This is the bolier plate code that every website has at the top. VS code populates this code for me by typeing ! key.
Once this is done I move the closing tags for main, body and html to the end of my code.-->

    <!--This is my NAV. This section allows the user to navigate between pages in the site. It includes the page names and links of the other pages.I copied and pasted this code into the other pages. The nav bar is styles a different color that the background of the body. The logo top-left has a hover. When you are on the other pages you can select either the Home text ofr the logo to return to the home page.-->

<!--I wanted the large image on the page to fully cover the background color, so I gave it a class its own class of hero-image and put it in its own div. I wanted the paragraph text on the home page to be centered so I gave it its own class of homeP and stuck it in a div.-->
