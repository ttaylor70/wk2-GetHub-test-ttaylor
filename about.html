    <!--This is sme nave bar on home page. I used the li element for the nav with an li as none. This gave me issues when I tried to build a list on this page. The logo and the home tag go back to the home page from all other pages and the logo has a hover. I think I would like to change the hover to be the same logo in a solid color rather than the colored box.-->

<!--I made an image container to hold the 2 images. I set the image container to overflow: hidden; property  my CSS so that the images would overflow the bounds of the container. I wanted to put a bigger space between the photos but coould not do that without the 2nd image moving to the next line. I sized the photos in photo shop so that they were exactly the same size and low resolution for speedy rendering -->

    <h2>Choosing the Right Wetsuit</h2>
    
    <p>Due to the variability of water temperatures and wind conditions, The Coeur d'Alene Triathlon reccomends that all swimmers wear a wetsuit. <br>Athletes participating in our traditional Olympic distance (1.5K swim) will board a cruise ship and enter the water out in the bay and swim back to shore.<br>
    The “Sprint Distance Triathlon” swimmers will take off from city beach one hour after the Olympic race begins.
    The Scenic Sprint consists of a 500-meter swim.</p>



<!--This is my list on the About page. I could not make this not have a style other than none.I managed to give a list-style to the first item. But I could not make the list stack without adding the <br> tag. I tried adding a list style of square to give it square bullets but if only worked on the first item. The li style I used in the nav kept overriding it frustrating. I made a class of other-list, but it did not seem to work in all instances.-->

<p><strong>There are several key factors to consider when buying your first open water wetsuit:</strong></p>
